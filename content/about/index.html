I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for learning and building things. My coding journey began around age 11 when I started writing games in QuickBasic. This ignited my passion for learning about programming as I started a tour through various other languages and paradigms, eventually ending with Javascript as my main language - although I’m always eager to learn new things, especially when it’s about the best tool for the job. Currently I'm working on Rust projects and switching my career track to using Rust as my main language.
