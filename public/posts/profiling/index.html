        <h1 id="profiling-clojure-and-rust-quasicrystals">Profiling Clojure and Rust Quasicrystals</h1>
<p>I rewrote my <a href="/posts/clojurequasi/">Clojure implementation</a> of my quasicrystal image generator to <a href="/posts/rustquasi/">Rust</a> for performance reasons. Before doing this I did try a couple of things to improve the Clojure performance, but after looking at a profile of the Clojure code, it became obvious that my fixes weren&rsquo;t addressing the core issue. I then decided to move to Rust because Rust seemed like a better tool for the job, and I wanted to learn more about it.</p>
<p>In this article we&rsquo;ll go over some of the things I tried to speed up my clojure code, and take a look at a flamegraph of the Clojure and Rust code to see where the performance (or lack thereof) comes from.</p>
<h2 id="clojure-performance-fixes">Clojure performance fixes</h2>
<p>As a baseline, running the sample code for the Clojure version takes about 45 seconds on my machine.</p>
<p>Before looking at a profile of the performance, I tried figuring out what was taking the most time. I figured since each pixel of each frame required several math function calls, that&rsquo;d be a good place to start.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was memoize everything I could. Memoization just adding a lookup table to a function. The function is called, and the inputs/outputs are stored in a table. Then when it&rsquo;s called with those inputs again, the table is used instead of redoing the function. Generating these images involves a lot of math, specifically <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, and <code>asin</code> function calls. A lot of the inputs are repeated, so I thought I could save some time memozing them. This did seem to be a little faster, but maybe not - the difference wasn&rsquo;t statistically significant.</p>
<p>Next I tried using different JVM math functions like <code>fastmath</code> and the code shared in this JVM game dev forum <a href="https://jvm-gaming.org/t/extremely-fast-sine-cosine/55153">thread</a>. Neither of these had an impact.</p>
<p>After some more investigation, I realized the JVM was probably already using the built in trig functions of my processor - so optimizing these was probably never going to see much if any speed increase.</p>
<h2 id="clojure-profiling">Clojure Profiling</h2>
<p>After realizing I couldn&rsquo;t really optimize the math part, I decided to look at a profile of the performance. I used the instructions on <a href="https://clojure-goes-fast.com/kb/profiling/clj-async-profiler/basic-usage/">clojure-goes-fast</a> to generate a flamegraph of my code:</p>
<p><img src="/profiling/clojure_flamegraph.jpg" alt="5 Clojure code flamegraph"></p>
<p>From looking at this I realized the bulk of the time wasn&rsquo;t spent on math but actually storing the pixels or possibly introp with the JVM. To draw the images I&rsquo;m using the <code>Graphics</code> JWT library. For each pixel I set the color and use <code>fillRect</code> to draw it. This makes it easy to set zoom levels, but is probably very inefficient - the graphics library wasn&rsquo;t really meant to be used this way, it was just easy for me to implement.</p>
<p>You can see in the graph that the largest bars are <code>java.lang.reflect.Method.copy</code>. This is a method that copies the methods of one class to another. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what&rsquo;s calling this method so much, but I suspect it has something to do with my approach to drawing graphics.</p>
<p>This is where I decided I either needed to completely rework the drawing part of the code, or switch to a faster language. The graphics options for Clojure didn&rsquo;t seem great at the time, so I switched to Rust.</p>
<h2 id="rust-profiling">Rust Profiling</h2>
<p>The Rust code was immediately much, much faster, so I never really needed to do performance fixes. But just to compare, I profiled a run of the Rust version using <a href="https://github.com/mstange/samply">samply</a>. I also compiled Rust with <code>debug-infolevel = 1</code> as described <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/profiling.html">here</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/profiling/rust_flamegraph.jpg" alt="5 Rust code flamegraph"></p>
<p>This run was much faster, about 2 seconds vs 45 for Clojure. There&rsquo;s not much to talk about with the graph - it pretty much just runs the main functions for the program and that&rsquo;s what takes the time. The pixels are written directly as bytes to memory then to my SSD, and there&rsquo;s no JVM overhead to slow things down.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to write fast graphics code in Rust than Java/Clojure. However the implementation of the Clojure version leaves a lot to be desired, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it&rsquo;s possible to get them pretty close to each other with more work. The Rust version was a lot harder to implement, but I suspect doing a fast Clojure version would be similar difficulty. That would probably involve writing the pixels to a buffer as bytes, then writing that to disk as an image - rather than using the Java graphics library to write a bunch of rects to a virtual graphics buffer.</p>
<p>Basically Rust forces you to do things the hard but performant way, whereas Clojure lets you do things easy but non-performant. Overall I like both languages, but they each have their niche.</p>
