        <p>I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for learning and building things. If I had to describe my career in one phrase, it would be “jumping right into the deep end”. My coding journey began around age 11 when I started writing games in QuickBasic. This ignited my passion for learning about programming as I started a tour through various other languages and paradigms, eventually ending with Javascript as my main language - although I’m always eager to learn new things, especially when it’s about the best tool for the job.
Along the way I found Linux and spent many hours installing various distributions and tinkering with configurations. Though I&rsquo;ve spent countless frustrated hours in the command line messing with config files I love Linux, and really believe it&rsquo;s the best operating system out there. I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to solving hard problems, so if you have any feel free to reach out!</p>
